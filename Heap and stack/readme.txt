----------------cStack----------------------
use "include "cStack.hpp"" to use cStack as an ADT.
size of array during constructor calling should be greater than or equal to size of red+blue stacks.
all standard operations are O(1).

---------------deque-------------------------
use "include "deque.hpp"" to use deque as ADt.
constant amount of space is used for all functions.
for removal and front or back worst case scenario is O(n),otherwise average case is O(1).

--------------heap-----------------------------
use "include "heap.hpp"" to use heap ADT.
buildHeap and mergeHeap are O(n) while size is O(1).
removemin,insert are O(logn).
